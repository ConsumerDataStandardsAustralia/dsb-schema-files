## Overview

For each version of the DSB released standards this repository contains *schemas* folder, which contains the  JSON definitions as declared in the published [CDR Technical Reference](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#introduction).

These definitions can be used for a variety of purposes. One such purpose is the schema validation in the context of API testing, eg such as a Postman collection.
The *postman* folder under each release contains a consolidated file with all definitions required for each sector.

For instance, these files are used in the [DSB Schema Test](https://www.postman.com/winter-shadow-541400/workspace/dsb-schema-tests) public workspace.For more information refer to the [dsb-postman](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/dsb-postman) repository.

## Postman Collection Test Suite

***Note: The Postman collections and instructions have now been moved to a new repository [dsb-postman](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/dsb-postman).
The implementation  of the dsb-postman repository is accessible as a public [Postman workspace](https://www.postman.com/winter-shadow-541400/workspace/dsb-schema-tests).***
