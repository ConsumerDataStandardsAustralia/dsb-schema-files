# JSON Schema Tool

## Overview

The JSON Schema Files Repository holds a comprehensive collection of JSON schema files derived from the official published [Consumer Data Standards](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#introduction) (CDS). The [Data Standards Body](https://consumerdatastandards.gov.au/about) maintains this repository of schema files to facilitate robust schema validation. 

## Using the JSON Schema Files

The repository is organised by release versions of the [Consumer Data Standards](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#introduction). For instance, to find schemas related to CDS release version 1.29.0, navigate to the 1.29.0 folder located in the repository's root directory.

This tool:

- is maintained regularly to ensure compatibility with the latest Consumer Data Standards.
- assists Data Holders with regulatory adherence by facilitating schema validation of data formats against the CDS, ensuring that the CDR API interactions comply with the required specifications and regulations.
- helps maintain data integrity and interoperability within the CDR ecosystem.

The schema files can be used for a variety of purposes. For instance, they can be used to 

- build a customised test harness for data holder payload validation
- create and maintain documentation
- build a data holder and/or data recipient solution

Example: You can use these files within our Postman Collection to validate your Data Holder API schemas during CDR API testing and development process. For more information, refer to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section below.

## Quick Start

The DSB provides an easy and quick way for the Data Holders to validate their API schemas using a combination of [DSB Postman Collections](https://www.postman.com/winter-shadow-541400/workspace/dsb-schema-tests), the [AJV (Another JSON Schema Validator) plugin](https://ajv.js.org/) configured within the Postman collection and the JSON schemas. 


### How They Work Together

The [DSB Postman Collections](https://www.postman.com/winter-shadow-541400/workspace/dsb-schema-tests) will reference the latest version folder within this repository and include the `postman-validation-<SECTOR>-<VERSION>.json` file for API validation purposes, depending on which Postman collection file is referenced (banking/energy/common).

The `postman-validation-<SECTOR>-<VERSION>.json` was created with the `build-sector-postman-schema-files.js` utility. It combines the individual json files into a single file for better performance in Postman. 

When an API call is made using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), the [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) plugin automatically validates the response against the JSON schema  designated for the particular API endpoint being tested. The schema acts as a "template" to ensure that the API response adheres to the required data structure and data types as specified by the CDS. If discrepancies are found (e.g., missing required fields, incorrect data types, additional properties not defined in the schema etc), AJV flags these as validation errors. The test results are displayed within Postman for debugging purposes to assist the developers or testers within the CDR Community during their CDR API testing and development process.

For more information on API testing with Postman, refer to the [Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/).
