# DSB Postman Tool - Registration API

These can be used to validate a Register API against published DSB schemas.

How to use:

- import the Postman collection (CDR Register API Conformance.postman_collection) into Postman
- import the Postman environment (ACCC Register.postman_environment) into Postman
- change the parameters in the Postman environment to suit the Register API being interrogated
- run the Postman collection

*Note:* The file *ACCC Register.postman_environment.json* is a Postman environment which utilises the current ACCC Register API.
