# DSB Schema Files 

This directory contains the individual schema files for all data structures defined by the Data Standards Body.
The Postman collection in this repository is one tool which utilises these definitions.

To use these schema files the folder should be used in its entirety as some of the schema files contain references to other files within this directory.
